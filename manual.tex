\section{Introduction}

FluxSol is a multiplatform, opensource CFD solver written in C++.
FluxSol is released under GNU GPL v.3+.
\section{Input File}

Input file is used by the solver to identify mesh, boundary conditions, schemes, and all the required fields. Format of this file is entirely based on "free-cfd" solver. Input file consist of a plain text document which comprises several fields. Each of these fields consists of a name followed by  “=” character. After this, a corresponding value of the field must to follow, ending with a “;” character. Some other fields (like “material”, “BC”, “patch”), whose values are more than one, do not contain “=” character after, they have instead certain parameters between parentheses, all of them with a parameter id followed by “=” and separated between them with a semicolon. An example of input file is presented below: \\

//Example of Input file.

grid\_1 {
	file = square.cgns;
	dimension = 2;
	solution\_scheme = navier-stokes;
	material 	(
				k=1.;
				rho=1.;);
	//material(dbname=air);	
	patch\_1(name=top;type=faces;list=[1,2,3];);	\\	
	BC\_2 (patch=BC-2;type=wall;U=[1.,0.,0.];);\\
	BC\_1 (patch=BC-4;type=wall;U=[0.,0.,0.];); \\
	BC\_3 (patch=BC-3;type=wall;U=0.0;); \\
	BC\_4 (patch=BC-1;type=wall;U=[0.,0.,0.];);\\	
}

\section{Nastran File Format}
FluxSol allows to import from Nastran file format. In order to include a Nastran mesh in one input file, the importer will check if the file extension is either ".bdf" or ".nas".

\section{Models}
In order to organize different type of system to be solved, FluxSol comes with different clasess each one containing different time schemes and equations systems. Each one of these models have an own solver which calls it. Access to these solvers can be done directly by command line, or, can be automatically done by the FluxSol executable. 
\subsection{StatFluidSol}
This is an stationary, segregated fluid model solver by the SIMPLE algorithm.
It can be found as StatFluidSol.
\subsection{StatFluidModel}
\subsection{StatThermoFluidSol}
This is an stationary, segregated SIMPLE fluid model solver and coupled with temperature.
It can be found as StatFluidSol.

\section{User Defined Objects (UDOs)}
UDO (User Defined Object) represents a custom defined  behavior (value, field, algorithm) which can be given to a different part (material, zone, condition) of the model. For this version it is restricted only to boundary conditions. UDO can be defined by two different ways: by CAE or via command line. In both cases a C++ code must be written and compiled in order to describe this behavior. Once it is compiled, it can be linked during runtime with the solver and thus, it can be implemented. 
To compile an UDO are required the following:
- cmake
If the operating system is Windows, it is required mingw-w64.
Once the code containing UDO is written, it must be compiled. 
An example of a C++ code is presented below. \\
File “udf\_boundary.cpp”:\\
\\
\#include "udf\_boundary.h"\\
using namespace FluxSol;\\
void ufield::Calculate()\\
\{
\\
    cout \textless\textless "UDF Calculating"\textless\textless endl;\\
	Scalar x;\\
	double xveloc;\\
\\
	for (int f=0;f<this-\textgreater\_Patch().Num\_Faces();f++)\\
	\\
		x=this-\textgreater\_Patch().Face(f).Center()[0]-0.5;\\
		xveloc=(0.25-(x.Val()*x.Val()))*100.0;\\
		this-\textgreater value[f]=Vec3D(xveloc,0.,0.);\\
	\\
\}\\ \\
File “udf\_boundary.h”:\\
\#include "FluxSol.h"\\
UD\_VelocityPatchField ufield;\\
\subsection{UDO via Command Line}

It must be compiled UDO file. The way to do that is running “udogen.bat” or “udogen.sh” depending on system. There are two options: it can be run this file without arguments, or either can be assigned the name of the .cpp file, only if this is only one file. //TO MODIFY
This file runs at first “CodeWriter.exe” followed by the file containing the code. This is a parsing program which creates another c++ file, named “UDOCreator.cpp”, which is compiled to obtain the shared library file. The bachfile output will ask for the confirmation of the user in order to overwrite libUDO shared library in case of successful compilation.
\\
This is a classic output of “CodeWriter.exe”\newline

\subsection{UDO via Graphic User Interface}
To define an UDO by FluxSol GUI, it must be compiled first.

\subsection{UDO Usage}
Once compiled the UDO, it can be used by the input file. Here is an example of input file. In the example below, object compiled in the previous example is implemented in the Patch named “BC-2”. To implement an UDO, the parameter “def” followed by their value “UDO”, must be present in the patch parameter list.

grid\_$1$
	file = Mesh\_Dens\_$10$.cgns;\\
	solution\_scheme = navier-stokes;\\	
	patch\_1(type=face;);\\
	material 	(k=1.;rho=1.;);\\
	\\//Definition default is by constant value 
	BC\_1 (patch=BC-2;type=wall;def=UDO;udo=ufield;); 	//Here is called UDO named ufield\\
	BC\_2 (patch=BC-1;type=wall;U=0.0;);\\
	BC\_3 (patch=BC-3;type=wall;U=0.0;); \\
	BC\_4 (patch=BC-4;type=wall;U=[0.,0.,0.];);\\
